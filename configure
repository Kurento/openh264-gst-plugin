# Preparation script for building the OpenH264 GStreamer plugin.
#
# This shell script downloads all dependencies and tools needed to build the
# 'gst-plugins-bad' module in a system where the OpenH264 library is installed.
# Doing so has the effect of enabling the generation of an OpenH264 GStreamer
# plugin, during the configuration phase of 'gst-plugins-bad'.



# Shell setup
# -----------

# Bash options for strict error checking
set -o errexit -o errtrace -o pipefail -o nounset

# Trace all commands
set -o xtrace



# Configure Apt
# -------------

# Disable interactive prompts
export DEBIAN_FRONTEND="noninteractive"

# Enable all source repositories
sed -i 's/# deb-src/deb-src/' /etc/apt/sources.list

apt-get update



# Install dependencies
# --------------------
