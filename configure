# Preparation script to build the OpenH264 GStreamer plugin.
#
# This shell script downloads all dependencies and tools needed to build the

# Doing so has the effect of enabling the generation of an OpenH264 GStreamer
# plugin, during the configuration phase of 'gst-plugins-bad'.

# -----------

# Bash options for strict error checking

# Configure Apt
# -------------

# Disable interactive prompts
export DEBIAN_FRONTEND="noninteractive"

# Enable all source repositories
sed -i 's/# deb-src/deb-src/' /etc/apt/sources.list
